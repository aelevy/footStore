   <h2>Iliotibial Band Syndrome</h2>
   <h3>SYMPTOMS</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Pain experienced on the lateral (outer) side of the knee</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Pain sometimes experienced in lateral thigh or lateral hip</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">The degree of discomfort can range from a dull aching to a sharp stabbing pain</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">The pain is usually not localized but covers a larger area</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>DEFINITION</h3>
   <h4>ILIOTIBIAL BAND</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">A thickening of the fascia that runs up the outside (lateral) thigh</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Connects to 2 muscles at the hip (Gluteus Maximus and Tensor Fasciae Latea) andthen down below the outside of the knee to the tibia (shin bone)</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">The primary function is to provide stability to the lateral knee while standing</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">It helps to maintain hip extension in standing and hip/knee flexion in running and walking</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">The IT-Band moves forward at the knee as the knee extends and slides backwardat the knee as the knee flexes, but is tense in both positions</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>ILIOTIBIAL BAND FRICTION SYNDROME</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Inflammation where the band/tendon/fascia rubs across the distal lateral femur (outside, of bottom end, ofthigh bone)</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Can be inflammation of the band/tendon, bursa under the tendon, or the periosteum (covering over bone) of femur</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>PRIMARY CAUSE</h3>
   <h4>EXCESSIVE PRONATION</h4>
   <ul>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Pronation is a normal movement of the foot, that allows the arch to flatten to a degree, which helps the body to absorb shock and adapt to different ground surfaces</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">In analyzing ones gait, first contact is on the heel and outside of the foot; followed by a shift of bodyweight continuing forward, toward the arch and toes</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">If the foot is weak or tired and/or the footwear is not supportive, then the arch can flatten more thannormal, which is excessive pronation</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Flattening of the arch (excessive pronation) places pressure on the foot and causes rotation to occur at the knee pulling on the IT Band. If the IT Band is not stretched enough it can cause inflammation</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">This repetitive, excessive pronation, is the main contributor to many lower extremity, overuse injuries</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6">
   <h3>CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</h3>
   <ul>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">With increasing age, often there is decreasing flexibility</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Any sudden change in activity, specifically, activities that increase weight bearing or pressure on the foot</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Changes in training – downhill running, running on banked surfaces, increasing training too quickly</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Anatomical abnormalities – leg length discrepancies, bow leg, and laxity of lateral knee ligament stability</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Underlying faulty pelvic mechanics</li>

   <span><h3>TREATMENT</h3> <p>- (advice given most often in literature)</p></span>
   <p>The 3 S's - Stretching, Strengthening and Supporting, along with ICE and REST, have been found to be the simplest and most effective treatment for these injuries.</p>
   <ul>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Stretching of the IT-Band, hamstring, piriformis and quad</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Strengthening of the hamstring, hip abductors, quad and gluteals (buttocks), for both the hip and kneeareas</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Supporting the foot with proper shoes and insoles, can prevent or help to eliminate the vast majority of stresses on the lower extremity. This may be a Birkenstock sandal, with a broad base and contoured foot bed, that is low to the ground and conforms to the foot. It may also be a shoe with an upper thatwraps the foot and supports the arch and heel, thus limiting excessive pronation. The vast majority of footwear have more than enough cushion but very little support for the arch and heel. One of the easiest and most effective solutions is to add a simple over the counter insole that provides a forgiving support forboth the arch and heel</li>
    <li><img src="images/footprint.png">Physical Therapy including ultrasound, electrical stimulation, and exercise</li>
